# <01-Challenge-Hiseon-Refactoring>

## Description

This project is a main landing page for the company 'Horiseon'. Horiseon helps offer online marketing and media presences to help grow other businesses.

This code was originally not properly formatted, hard to read, and had many semantic errors. The main goal was to keep the initial structure of the landing page 
while refactoring the html and css code to be more readable and user friendly. This helps any developer to easily open the code in the future and edit find something they 
are looking for with ease.

## Installation

To install the project, download the 'index.html' file and 'Assets' folder. The folder contains the associated CSS and images. 

## Usage

Open the HTML in your favorite IDE and run the code in a browser.
